                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>
                        I am a Senior QA Engineer and QA Leader with <strong>14+ years</strong> of experience in software quality assurance for web and mobile applications. 
                        I specialize in building effective testing strategies, leading QA teams, and driving quality initiatives that align with business goals.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My background spans both hands-on testing (functional, regression, integration) and strategic leadership, including team management, risk assessment, resource planning, and cross-functional collaboration. 
                        I have a strong track record of identifying quality risks early and working closely with Product and Engineering teams to ensure reliable, scalable releases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a QA leader, I focus on fostering collaboration, mentoring engineers, and continuously improving testing processes through clear metrics and modern tooling. 
                        I am particularly interested in leveraging AI and LLM-based tools to reduce repetitive work, improve test efficiency, and accelerate delivery without compromising quality.
